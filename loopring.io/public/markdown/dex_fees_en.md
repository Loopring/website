Loopring Exchange charges fees per service type. Each service has a **flat-fee** and a **percentage fee**. For the percentage fee, there is also a **minimal-fee** applied.
 The acutal fee charged for a service is `flat_fee + max(minimal_fee, percentage_fee * volume)`.

All users share the same **flat-fee**s and **minimal-fee**s, but VIPs have different percentange fee settings.

### Maker Rebates

Maker orders will receive 0.02% trading volume as rebate.

### Affiliate Rewards

For every trade our affiliates contribute, the reward we pay per taker order in orderbooks is calculated as follows:

`
(trading_fee - maker_rebate) * trade_volume * 20%
`

the reward we pay per taker order in AMM is calculated as follows:

`
(trading_fee - liquidity_fee) * trade_volume * 20%
`
Out of the affiliate reward for a taker order, 50% will be given to the user's registration referral up to 3 months; and 50 will be given to the third-party platform that contributed the order.
If the taker doesn't have a registration referral or the order is submitted directly without going through a third-party platform, then all affiliate reward will go to Loopring relayer.
