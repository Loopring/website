      "title": " Secure",
      "explain": "Loopring is an open-sourced, audited, and non-custodial exchange and payment protocol. Nobody in the Loopring ecosystem needs to trust others. zkRollup assures assets are always under users' own control; 100% Ethereum-level security guarantees."

    {
      "title": "High Throughput",
      "explain": "Loopring powers highly scalable decentralized exchanges and payments by batch-processing thousands of requests off-chain, with verifiably correct execution via ZKPs. The performance of Ethereum is no longer the bottleneck."

    {
      "title": "Low Cost",
      "explain": "Loopring performs most operations, including trade and transfer settlement, off the Ethereum blockchain. This dramatically reduces gas consumption and overall transaction cost to small fractions of comparable on-chain cost."
