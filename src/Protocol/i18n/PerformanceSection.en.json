  "throughputDetail": "Loopring 3.0 can settle up to <b>1,400</b> trades per second while guaranteeing the same level of security as the underlying Ethereum blockchain. This is made possible by using a construction called <b>zkRollup</b>, and a feature called <b>On-Chain Data Availability</b>, or <b>OCDA</b>. If OCDA is disabled, Loopring throughput becomes as high as <b>10,500</b> trades per second, but security reduces to that of the consortium which maintains said data.",
  "costDetail": "The average settlement cost for each trade is now as low as <b>$0.005 USD</b>, which covers the gas for Ethereum transactions and the cost of proof generation on cloud computing platforms. DEXes can further lower the settlement cost to about $0.0025 USD by using cheaper servers in the cloud and GPU-based algorithms. To put things in perspective, most brokers' stock trading fees in the US are in the range of $2 to $7 USD per trade."
