  "throughputDetail": "Loopring 3.0 can settle up to <b>350</b> trades per second while guaranteeing the same level of security as the underlying Ethereum blockchain. This is made possible by using a construction called <b>zkRollup</b>, and a feature called <b>On-Chain Data Availability</b>, or <b>OCDA</b>. If OCDA is disabled, Loopring throughput becomes much higher, as shown in the table below, but security reduces to that of the consortium which maintains said data.",
  "costDetail": "The average settlement cost for each trade is as low as <b>$0.0021 USD</b>, which covers the gas for Ethereum transactions and the cost of proof generation on cloud computing platforms. DEXes can further lower the settlement cost by using cheaper servers in the cloud and GPU-based algorithms. To put things in perspective, most brokers' stock trading fees in the US are in the range of $2 to $7 USD per trade."
